<p style="font-family:calibribody;">

•	If you cannot find a way to evacuate the building in time and you become trapped in the building try to keep your mouth closed to inhale less smoke, try to bang or make sound with tools around you until help (firefighters) reaches you. 
</p>
<p style="font-family:calibribody;">
•	Any fire drills are done throughout the day before pick up, therefore if a fire alarm goes off when in the building it would most likely be a real fire therefore you need to act quickly.
