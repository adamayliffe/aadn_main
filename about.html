    <p>
          At Amy’s Angels Day Nursery we understand the challenges that working parents and parents going back into education face creating a work, nursery and home balance. Which is why at Amys Angels Day Nursery we offer an extended Day for working parents which allows you to work worry free that your child is in a safe and happy place with nurturing staff.
        </p>
<p>
Here at Amy’s Angles Day Nursery we provide children with an individual routine similar to the one they have at home which allows your child to feel safe and secure while in our care. The environment we have created nurtures as well as gives your child independence throughout the day.
</p>
<p>
We offer a variety of snacks, meals and drinks throughout the day to all children and have an incredible chef who takes the time out of his/her day to get to know all of the allergies and dietary requirements of all the children at the setting. Our chef also implements an all inclusive service which means no child is left out, therefore our chef always finds an alternative which is healthy and right for all of the children in our care.
</p>
<p>
Along with all of this we have sleeping, changing and quiet area facilities so whatever your child needs throughout the day we are able to provide for them in this caring and wonderful environment.  If you child is here late  (7:00) we offer them a healthy and nutritious tea (dinner).  After tea or dinner if your child is feeling restless, tired or anxious they can have a short nap or sit quietly with a staff member in the quiet area and be read too or even go into the sensory room to relax after a busy day of playing with friends.
</p>
<p>
Our staff members are highly trained and knowledgeable to the highest possible standards and will provide exceptional care for your child/ children.  The staff are enthusiastic, cheerful and spirited in everything that they do with the children. This is very important to everyone at the setting as it creates a positive, nurturing and fun environment for the children continuously throughout the day allowing the children to learn and enjoy themselves and putting a smile on their faces.
</p>
<p>

Children are able to develop independence and decision making skills by choosing different options throughout the day as well as what they want to play with (free play). This teaches the children decision making which is one of the most important skill a child could ever have in life to ensure their future is bright. With this skill the children can dream big.
</p>

Your Sincerely
